#How to play

Objective
The goal of the maze game is to navigate through a vertical maze and be the first player to reach the exit.

Controls
Jump Up: Hold your phone upright and move it upwards.
Move Left: Tilt your phone to the left.
Move Right: Tilt your phone to the right.

Game Mechanics
The maze is designed to be played in a vertical orientation, so ensure your phone is held straight for optimal control.
Players must be cautious of gravity power-ups, which are square-shaped and rotate. When a player collides with one of these power-ups, their ball experiences a temporary state of zero gravity, making navigation more challenging.

Player Interaction
The movement of each player influences the maze's layout. The average movements of all players will cause the maze to shift, adding an additional layer of strategy to the game.

Winning the Game
The first player to successfully navigate through the maze and reach the exit is declared the winner.
